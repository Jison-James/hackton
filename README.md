## Basic Details
### Team Name: JISON JAMES


### Team Members
- Team Lead: JISON JAMS - VISWAJYOTHI COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY VAZHAKULMAM


### Project Description
A web-based, unhinged AI ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù that roasts, mocks, and gives savage, sarcastic replies to user inputs. It supports webcam face roasts, food analysis, palm reading, riddle/chat interactions, and a few mini-games for chaotic fun.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The internet is full of overly polite AIs. Nobody is brave enough to tell you your hairstyle looks like a rejected mop, or that your lunch choice is a crime against humanity.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built Useless Friend ‚Äî a foul-mouthed, sarcasm-charged AI that lives in your browser and has no filter.
It uses face detection, random insults, and pure chaos to roast you into becoming a better (or at least more self-aware) human.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:

Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Frameworks: None (chaos doesn‚Äôt need frameworks)

Libraries: Custom roast logic, Webcam API (getUserMedia), AI API calls via api.js

Tools: VS Code, Git, GitHub Pages

For Hardware:

Main components: Webcam (built-in or external)

Specifications: Any modern laptop/PC with a browser that supports getUserMedia

Tools required: Internet connection, tissues for your tears
### Implementation
